Slidder:
<mat-slider> allows for the selection of a value from a range via mouse, touch, or keyboard, similar to <input type="range">.
	<mat-slider> </mat-slider>
Note: the sliding behavior for this component requires that HammerJS is loaded on the page.

Selecting a value
By default the minimum value of the slider is 0, the maximum value is 100, and the thumb moves in increments of 1. These values can be 
changed by setting the min, max, and step attributes respectively. The initial value is set to the minimum value unless otherwise specified.
	<mat-slider min="1" max="5" step="0.5" value="1.5"></mat-slider>
  
Orientation
By default sliders are horizontal with the minimum value on the left and the maximum value on the right. The vertical attribute can be 
added to a slider to make it vertical with the minimum value on bottom and the maximum value on top.

  <mat-slider vertical></mat-slider>
An invert attribute is also available which can be specified to flip the axis that the thumb moves along. 
An inverted horizontal slider will have the minimum value on the right and the maximum value on the left,
while an inverted vertical slider will have the minimum value on top and the maximum value on bottom.
	<mat-slider invert></mat-slider>

Thumb label
By default, the exact selected value of a slider is not visible to the user. However, this value can be added to the thumb by adding the thumbLabel attribute.
The Material Design spec recommends using the thumbLabel attribute (along with tickInterval="1") only for sliders that are used to display a discrete value (such as a 1-5 rating).
	<mat-slider thumbLabel tickInterval="1"></mat-slider>

Slide Toggel:
	<mat-slide-toggle> is an on/off control that can be toggled via clicking or dragging.
