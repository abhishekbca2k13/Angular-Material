Tree:
The mat-tree provides a Material Design styled tree that can be used to display hierarchy data.
There are two types of trees: Flat tree and nested tree. The DOM structures are different for these two types of trees.

Flat tree
In a flat tree, the hierarchy is flattened; nodes are not rendered inside of each other, but instead are rendered as siblings in
sequence. An instance of TreeFlattener is used to generate the flat list of items from hierarchical data. The "level" of each tree
node is read through the getLevel method of the TreeControl; this level can be used to style the node such that it is indented to the
appropriate level.

<mat-tree>
  <mat-tree-node> parent node </mat-tree-node>
  <mat-tree-node> -- child node1 </mat-tree-node>
  <mat-tree-node> -- child node2 </mat-tree-node>
</mat-tree>

Nested tree
In Nested tree, children nodes are placed inside their parent node in DOM. The parent node has an outlet to keep all the children nodes.

Features
The <mat-tree> itself only deals with the rendering of a tree structure. Additional features can be built on top of the tree by 
adding behavior inside node templates (e.g., padding and toggle). Interactions that affect the rendered data (such as expand/collapse)
should be propagated through the table's data source.

TreeControl
The TreeControl controls the expand/collapse state of tree nodes. Users can expand/collapse a tree node recursively through tree control.
For nested tree node, getChildren function need to pass to the NestedTreeControl to make it work recursively. 
The getChildren function may return an observable of children for a given node, or an array of children. For flattened tree node, 
getLevel and isExpandable functions need to pass to the FlatTreeControl to make it work recursively.

Toggle
A matTreeNodeToggle can be added in the tree node template to expand/collapse the tree node. The toggle toggles the expand/collapse 
functions in TreeControl and is able to expand/collapse a tree node recursively by setting [matTreeNodeToggleRecursive] to true.

The toggle can be placed anywhere in the tree node, and is only toggled by click action.

Padding (Flat tree only)
The matTreeNodePadding can be placed in a flat tree's node template to display the level information of a flat tree node.

Nested tree does not need this padding since padding can be easily added to the hierarchy structure in DOM.

 Accessibility
Trees without text or labels should be given a meaningful label via aria-label or aria-labelledby. The aria-readonly defaults to true 
if it's not set.

Tree's role is tree. Parent nodes are given role="group", while leaf nodes are given role="treeitem"

mat-tree does not manage any focus/keyboard interaction on its own. Users can add desired focus/keyboard interactions in their 
application.
