Grid List:
mat-grid-list is a two-dimensional list view that arranges cells into grid-based layout. See Material Design spec here.
<mat-grid-list cols="2" rowHeight="2:1">
  <mat-grid-tile>1</mat-grid-tile>
  <mat-grid-tile>2</mat-grid-tile>
  <mat-grid-tile>3</mat-grid-tile>
  <mat-grid-tile>4</mat-grid-tile>
</mat-grid-list>
Setting the number of columns
An mat-grid-list must specify a cols attribute which sets the number of columns in the grid. The number of rows will be automatically 
determined based on the number of columns and the number of items.



Tile headers and footers
A header and footer can be added to an mat-grid-tile using the mat-grid-tile-header and mat-grid-tile-footer elements respectively.
