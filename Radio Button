Radio Button:
<mat-radio-button> provides the same functionality as a native <input type="radio"> enhanced with Material Design styling and animations.

Radio-button label
The radio-button label is provided as the content to the <mat-radio-button> element. The label can be positioned before or after the radio-button by setting the labelPosition property to 'before' or 'after'.

Radio groups
Radio-buttons should typically be placed inside of an <mat-radio-group> unless the DOM structure would make that impossible (e.g., radio-buttons inside of table cells). The radio-group has a value property that reflects the currently selected radio-button inside of the group.

Use with @angular/forms
<mat-radio-group> is compatible with @angular/forms and supports both FormsModule and ReactiveFormsModule.
