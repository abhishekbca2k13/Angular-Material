Badge:
Badges are small status descriptors for UI elements. A badge consists of a small circle, typically containing a number or other short
set of characters, that appears in proximity to another object.

Badge position
By default, the badge will be placed above after. The direction can be changed by defining the attribute matBadgePosition follow 
by above|below and before|after.
	<mat-icon matBadge="22" matBadgePosition="above after">home</mat-icon>

The overlap of the badge in relation to its inner contents can also be defined using the matBadgeOverlap tag. Typically,
you want the badge to overlap an icon and not a text phrase. By default it will overlap.

	<h1 matBadge="11" matBadgeOverlap="false">
 		 Email
	</h1>

 Badge sizing
The badge has 3 sizes: small, medium and large. By default, the badge is set to medium. You can change the size by adding 
matBadgeSize to the host element.

	<h1 matBadge="11" matBadgeSize="large">
		  Email
	</h1>
 Badge visibility
The badge visibility can be toggled programmatically by defining matBadgeHidden.
	<h1 matBadge="11" [matBadgeHidden]="!visible">
		  Email
	</h1>

Theming
Badges can be colored in terms of the current theme using the matBadgeColor property to set the background color to primary, 
accent, or warn.
	<mat-icon matBadge="22" matBadgeColor="accent">
 		 home
	</mat-icon>
