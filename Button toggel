Button toggel:
<mat-button-toggle> are on/off toggles with the appearance of a button. These toggles can be configured to behave as either radio-buttons
or checkboxes. While they can be standalone, they are typically part of a mat-button-toggle-group.

<mat-button-toggle-group name="fontStyle" aria-label="Font Style">
  <mat-button-toggle value="bold">Bold</mat-button-toggle>
  <mat-button-toggle value="italic">Italic</mat-button-toggle>
  <mat-button-toggle value="underline">Underline</mat-button-toggle>
</mat-button-toggle-group>

Exclusive selection vs. multiple selection
By default, mat-button-toggle-group acts like a radio-button group- only one item can be selected. In this mode, the value of the
mat-button-toggle-group will reflect the value of the selected button and ngModel is supported.

Adding the multiple attribute allows multiple items to be selected (checkbox behavior). In this mode the values of the toggles are
not used, the mat-button-toggle-group does not have a value, and ngModel is not supported.
