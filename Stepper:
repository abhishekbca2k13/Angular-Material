Stepper:
Angular Material's stepper provides a wizard-like workflow by dividing content into logical steps.

Material stepper builds on the foundation of the CDK stepper that is responsible for the logic that drives a stepped workflow.
Material stepper extends the CDK stepper and has Material Design styling.

Stepper variants
There are two stepper components: mat-horizontal-stepper and mat-vertical-stepper. They can be used the same way.
The only difference is the orientation of stepper.

Stepper buttons
There are two button directives to support navigation between different steps: matStepperPrevious and matStepperNext.
<mat-horizontal-stepper>
  <mat-step>
    ...
    <div>
      <button mat-button matStepperPrevious>Back</button>
      <button mat-button matStepperNext>Next</button>
    </div>
  </mat-step>
</mat-horizontal-stepper>

Linear stepper
The linear attribute can be set on mat-horizontal-stepper and mat-vertical-stepper to create a linear stepper that requires the user
to complete previous steps before proceeding to following steps. For each mat-step, the stepControl attribute can be set to the top 
level AbstractControl that is used to check the validity of the step.

There are two possible approaches. One is using a single form for stepper, and the other is using a different form for each step.

Alternatively, if you don't want to use the Angular forms, you can pass in the completed property to each of the steps which won't
allow the user to continue until it becomes true. Note that if both completed and stepControl are set, the stepControl will take precedence.
