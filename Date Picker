DatePicker:
The datepicker allows users to enter a date either through text input, or by choosing a date from the calendar. 
It is made up of several components and directives that work together.

<mat-form-field>
  <input matInput [matDatepicker]="picker" placeholder="Choose a date">
  <mat-datepicker-toggle matSuffix [for]="picker"></mat-datepicker-toggle>
  <mat-datepicker #picker></mat-datepicker>
</mat-form-field>

Form Field
<mat-form-field> is a component used to wrap several Angular Material components and apply common Text field styles such as the underline,
floating label, and hint messages.

In this document, "form field" refers to the wrapper component <mat-form-field> and "form field control" refers to the component that the 
<mat-form-field> is wrapping (e.g. the input, textarea, select, etc.)
