Card:
<mat-card> is a content container for text, photos, and actions in the context of a single subject.
	<mat-card>Simple card</mat-card>

Basic card sections
The most basic card needs only an <mat-card> element with some content. However, Angular Material provides a number of preset sections 
that you can use inside of an <mat-card>:


Element		        	  Description
<mat-card-title>		  Card title
<mat-card-subtitle>		Card subtitle
<mat-card-content>		Primary card content. Intended for blocks of text
<img mat-card-image>	Card image. Stretches the image to the container width
<mat-card-actions>		Container for buttons at the bottom of the card
<mat-card-footer>		  Section anchored to the bottom of the card

These elements primary serve as pre-styled content containers without any additional APIs. However, the align property on 
<mat-card-actions> can be used to position the actions at the 'start' or 'end' of the container.
