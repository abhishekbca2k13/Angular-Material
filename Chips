Chips:
<mat-chip-list> displays a list of values as individual, keyboard accessible, chips.
	<mat-chip-list aria-label="Fish selection">
		  <mat-chip>One fish</mat-chip>
		  <mat-chip color="accent" selected>Accent fish</mat-chip>
	</mat-chip-list>

Selection
Chips can be selected via the selected property. Selection can be disabled by setting selectable to false on the <mat-chip-list>.

Whenever the selection state changes, a ChipSelectionChange event will be emitted via (selectionChange).

Chip input
The MatChipInput directive can be used together with a chip-list to streamline the interaction between the two components. 
This directive adds chip-specific behaviors to the input element within <mat-form-field> for adding and removing chips. 
The <input> with MatChipInput can be placed inside or outside the chip-list element.
